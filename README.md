# Visual-Odometry-and-3D-Reconstruction-of-Scene

The following repository consists of implementations of Visual Odometry in C++ as well as Python. The notebook files detail feature matching and trajectory estimation. The C++ files provide a better visualization of the same by representing the trajectory as a window moving through a point cloud of feature points. The repository also consists of a 3D Reconstruction pipeline that is capable of generating the 3D point cloud of a scene from either 2D representations of the scene or from stereo captures of the scene.
